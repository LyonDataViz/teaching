### Spendings Visualization

[demo](https://john-spendings-viz.github.io)

We would like to visualize the spendings of a student belonging to our group (we will call him John to keep anonymity) over several years.
The 3 main goals of this visualization are:

- to be able to see in which category John is spending the most/the least
- to be able to track the evolution of John's spendings over a year
- to be able to compare those results with national data and students'
