This project aims to help Samuel, the data provider, to get a new perspective on his running. Moreover, this concept can be useful for any runner.

* A first vizualisation will allow us to answer several questions : where is the runner most consistent ? What are the characteristics of the different tracks, how many runs do we have on each track ?

* Once we select a track on the first vizualisation, we can discover another graphic. Here, we can ask ourselves : for the selected track, what is the best run, the most consistent one ? Choosing a specific run will allow us to get more details, in a dedicated section. The elevation changes are also represented, to help the interpretation.

The final goal is to allow the runner to get a more global view of differents tracks, and eventually help him what makes him loose (or gain) performance.
