## [Netflix Data Visualisation](https://boumaza-sebia.github.io/dataviz-netflix/)


How much time do we spend in front of our streaming platforms? Which content have we watched since our subscription? 

These are the questions this project attempts to answer. Using the personal data linked to the *Netflix* account shared by the two authors of this project, we built a page containing 4 visualizations that describe the characteristics of the views (content and duration) of the 3 profiles of the common account: "Hana", "Tarik" and " Together " (when Hana and Tarik watch content together).
