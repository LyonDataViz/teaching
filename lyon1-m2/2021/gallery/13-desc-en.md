## [Screen time analysis on smartphone](leoh42.github.io/dataviz)
The cell phone today is not just a tool for making and answering calls. It has so many features that it is very difficult for most of us to part with it. It can even be said that it represents a certain extension of the human hand as we often have it in our hands. Whether it's in transportation, at work, in our kitchen or elsewhere, our phone always has a good reason to be present and to be solicited, even indispensable.

 In fact, the French spend an average of two hours a day on their smartphone, according to a study by the American firm App Annie. This is much less than young people, who spend nearly 4 hours on their smartphones (source: BFMTV Pauline Dumonteil).
 
 By looking at our data that summarizes the use of our phones, we realized that we use it differently depending on what is going on in our lives. The type of application used will be different depending on whether we are on vacation abroad, in the middle of an exam or alone at home on a day off.
 It is these variations in use that we have sought to observe during this project.
