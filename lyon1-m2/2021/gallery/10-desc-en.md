# Data Visualization project: neural data analysis from magnetoencephalography

Participants were given a task of listening to standardized pieces of music in order to record their brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Magnetoencephalography is a technique for measuring magnetic fields induced by the electrical activity of neurons. It is composed of 248 channels distributed over the entire cranial surface. Thanks to this technique, local modifications of the electromagnetic field that propagate at the speed of light can be detected "in real time". This imaging method provides spatio-temporal maps of electrical and metabolic events related to mental activities.

Participants were invited to listen to short excerpts of music under different experimental conditions, mainly around excerpts that were more or less rhythmic and whose rhythm was more or less complex. 

The objective of this project is to provide a visualization of :

1. Localization of MEG channels (Figure 1)
2. To be able to identify active brain areas according to different frequency bands (Figure 2)
3. To be able to quickly visualize frequency bands of interest (Figure 3)
4. To try to provide brain activation patterns (i.e. areas activating simultaneously) (Figure 4)
