[demo](https://ggoupy.github.io/csgo-dataviz/)
  
The objective of this project is to visualize the performance of a player on the online game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Many tools are already available to meet this need. However, most of them do not offer (or only a few) comparisons between the players inside of the game and do not analyze the performances by round. Thus, this project has the particular goal of answering these two needs: more detailed analyses on the whole game and comparisons between players. It will bring tools, which can be useful for occasional players as well as for professional teams, to answer the following questions: 
- How can I improve myself ? 
- Which team is best for me? 
- What position is best for me? 
- What weapons do I use most effectively? 
- In which situations do I perform best?
