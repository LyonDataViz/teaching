[demo](https://reathe.github.io/spotify-dataviz/)

Visualization of a study of the listening habits of two members of the groupe of 3. Artists/albums/songs/genres, but also the distribution of the listens over time, divided in sessions, in a typical day.

Variations in listening habits :

- Many artists & few songs for each (wide) vs. the opposite (deep)
- Eclectic in musical genres or rather chauvinistic. Genre representation in all artists listened to
- Rate of popular songs listened to per artist
- Artist
- Differences in listen time :
    - average listen time per hour in the day, detailed
    - distribution of listen sessions over time, in intervals
- Study of artist listen distribution over time as a chronology
