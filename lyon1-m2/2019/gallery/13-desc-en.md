[Analysis of IOS applications](https://douniaelou.github.io/myprojet/)


One of the main objective of this project is decision-making aid for 
iOS applications creators, because our visualizations allow us to show links between criteria
important for iOS app choices. For example, we have
visualizations which allow you to see the link between the price of an application, its size (in MB),
and the number of times it has been downloaded. All this information will be very useful
to the creators of applications because it will allow them to orient their choice
on creating an app.
