# Youtube Data Vizualisation

### Surroundings
We did this project in the context of Data vizualisation course (https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2021/) of the Data Science Master at the Claude Bernard University.

### Subject
The project's topic was the visual representation of our personnels datas. We chose to depict our Youtube history with 2 shapes : one linear graph and one pie chart.
We gathered our datas thanks to Google API (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis)
