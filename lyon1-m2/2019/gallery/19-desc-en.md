[Data consumption of social networks on mobile devices (environmental impact, comparison with other applications)](https://github.com/Aemiyh/Consommation-de-donnees-reseaux-sociaux)

Our visualization shows the data consumption of social networks on mobile as well as its environmental impact.
In fact, we use various mobile applications on a daily basis but we do not really know their consumption (data stored and consumption in mobile/wifi data). The storage of data generated by its applications in datacenters generates digital pollution and environmental impact.
Our goal was therefore to raise awareness of this impact in the use of social networks in our daily lives.
This visualisation is intended for a wide audience, but more particularly for the young population of the digital era who are the biggest users of social networks.
