# Data consumption with and without add-blocker

This project aims to show the effect of add-blockers on data consumption and loading time.
Advertisements can indeed be an important part of the data and blocking it can be a way of reducing the loading time and our consumption.
We have collected data on the 30 most visited websites with and without add-blocker to develop this datavizualisation.
