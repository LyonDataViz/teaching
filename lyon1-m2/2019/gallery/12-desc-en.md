### [Power-consumption-analogy](https://jbguimbaud.github.io/Power-consumption-analogy/)

Within this project, we're coming from two simple observations :
* Our usage of computers has electric cost and therefore an environmental impact
* We have little to no concrete representations to help us understand that very impact

That is why we want to help people visualize their electric energy consumption, using an analogy with several *sportive activities*.  
We propose a visualisation of the hourly volume of sport you would have to perform in order to supply your computer (laptop or desktop) for your daily use.
