# Toxicity League Of Legends

## Summary

[League Of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com), developed by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com), is one of the world's most popular game, however unfavorably known for the notorious toxicity and overall incivility of its community. Using data collected directly from players and the games they played, our goal is to try to identify the sources of certain toxic behaviours.

Our visualisations can answer the following questions:
- Which game factors are significant in characterizing a potential toxic player?
- Are playable champions balanced?
- Does [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com) have any responsabilities regarding its community toxicity?
