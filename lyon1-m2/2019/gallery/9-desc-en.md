### [VizHabits](https://abardou.github.io/viz-habits/#/)

This projet aims to complete existing visualisations of users smartphones habits. The idea behind this project is based on a fact : we didn't find any visualization able to show us usage profiles based on application switches and sequences of applications.   
We propose two visualisations for two differents purpose :  
* A Force Graph, representing which app the user usually go to after using a specific application.
* A Radial Tree (Tidy), representing all sequences started by unlocking the phone (Screen ON) and terminated by locking the phone (Screen OFF).

As our visualizations can be a bit messy when the amount of data to display grows, we decided to work on how we can effectively filter our visualisations to be more user friendly. These filters can also be a great tool to explore different usage profiles by navigating through several dimensions, including time and space.
