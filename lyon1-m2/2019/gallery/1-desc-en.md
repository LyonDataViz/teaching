### [Analysis of popularity of programming languages used in GitHub](https://nellybarret.github.io/GithubLanguagesAnalysis/)

This project offers a vizualisation of the popularity of programming languages used in GitHub. 
It is based on some metrics to measure popularity, like the number of stars and the number of forks, and it is displayed year by year.
The main goal of our project is to give tools to junior developpers (for example, to help them to choose a language for their project) and to senior developpers by helping them to be up-to-date.
