## Impacte de la COVID-19 sur les les Ã©missions de CO2

The production of greenhouse gas emissions has continued to accompany
the technological growth of humanity. Our growing
production is precipitating us towards a depletion of our resources.

The arrival of COVID-19 has changed our way of life. Everything bears
to believe that its consequences are correlated with a decrease of
the production of CO2.

We have sought to highlight this impact in order to
to show people who will see our date-visualization, that
their behaviour can have a direct impact on pollution
atmospheric pollution, global warming, and the state of the world of tomorrow.
