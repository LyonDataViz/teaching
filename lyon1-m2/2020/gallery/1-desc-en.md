# Title : Climate effects on food supply

Within the framework of this study, we wanted to focus on the influence of climate change on the production of 3 cereals: rice, corn and wheat. In coming decades, the agricultural sector will be faced with many challenges, particularly that of climate change, which is likely to disrupt the production and availability of cereal resources in many parts of the world. Thanks to SEDAC (SocioEconomic Data and Applications Center) dataset presenting the agricultural yields for the coming decades of 3 cereals (rice, maize and wheat), we propose a visualization to better analyze the consequences of climate change on the supply of these cereals worldwide.
