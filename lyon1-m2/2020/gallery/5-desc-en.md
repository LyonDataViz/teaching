### Extraction of natural mineral reserves

[demo](https://github.com/asolayman/DataViz-World-ressources)

Nowadays we often hear that rare metals are in short supply, that it will no longer be possible to build lithium-ion batteries, and that gold and platinum will soon be in short supply.  
This would mean that it would no longer be possible to build electronic devices such as computers or telephones.  
However, these statements are never accompanied by any data or visualization that would allow these conclusions to 
be drawn, and there are only various reports on the subject, in which the data is not even formatted for use.  
The aim of our website is therefore to provide an overview of the reserves and rate of consumption of minerals in electronic devices.
