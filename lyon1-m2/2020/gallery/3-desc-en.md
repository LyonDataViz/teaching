### European e-waste treatment

[demo](https://ev07.github.io/e-waste.dataviz/)

We were interested in exploring the production of electronic waste (WEEE) in Europe. This thematic is one that echoes with us, as consummers, and citizens of the EU. We have created a few elements of visualisation, to describe in depth the statistics known on this phenonmenon. To achieve this, we have created a three pages website.

It consists in:
 - An introductory webpage that explains why the thematic is important and why we choose it, and helps contextualize the EU in the global flows of e-waste.
 - The main visualization, in the form of a dashboard:
   - An interactive map of the EU, displaying in color scale the quantity of e-waste per country.
   - A histogram showing the evolution of the total over the EU of the volume of waste
   - A diagram comparing for a given country the quantity of waste produced and collected for each type of e-waste. The country can be selected by left-clicking on the particular country on the map.
   - A histogram comparing for a given country the quantities produced for each category, for a given year.
   - A year selector, changing the map and second histogram to display the selected year.
   - A waste category selector, changing the map and the first histogram
   - A waste disposal step selector (production, collection, recycling), changing the map and the first histogram
   - An explanation of what the selected category and disposal step correspond to.
 - About page, linking to the course and Master webpage, giving the sources of the data, and with our names.
