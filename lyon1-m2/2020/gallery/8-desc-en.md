### Global Warming

[demo](https://github.com/AdrianKh/RechauffementClimatique)

In this project, we are going to tackle a subject that is often mentioned but never enough: global warming. The massive industrialization of societies since the start of the 20th century has been accompanied by disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions.
This issue requires collective awareness, and for this we have chosen an awareness strategy through visualization. The objective is obviously not to portray a catastrophic scenario as is often done, but only to transcribe as objectively as possible the data observed and predicted by the experts.
