### Environmental scrollytelling with predictions

[demo](https://github.com/komann12/Scrollytelling_indicateurs_environnement)

We wanted to inform and raise awareness about the various indicators of climate change. We have therefore experimented
with different techniques to engage the user when he consults our visualizations; for example by proposing to make
predictions on our indicators. We also chose to test the scrollytelling approach in order to make the userâ€™s experience
more fun and encourage them to visit the site as long as possible.
