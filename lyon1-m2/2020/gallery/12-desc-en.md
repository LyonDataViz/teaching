[Environmental scrollytelling with predictions](https://github.com/komann12/Scrollytelling_indicateurs_environnement)

We wanted to inform and raise awareness about the various indicators of climate change. We have therefore experimented
with different techniques to engage the user when he consults our visualizations; for example by proposing to make
predictions on our indicators. We also chose to test the scrollytelling approach in order to make the user’s experience
more fun and encourage them to visit the site as long as possible.
