# DatavizDechet

The goal of this page is to have a visualisation of [French waste](https://data.ademe.fr/datasets/sinoe-(r)-destination-des-dechets-collectes-en-decheterie-par-type-de-traitement).
To do so, one can use:
  - A region map, to have the tonnage depending on its type of the way it is treated
  - A stacked barplot to compare waste depending on its region or year
  - A pie chart to have the tonnage percent with different factors
