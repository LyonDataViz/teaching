As the environmental activist Greta Thunberg said " We aren’t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. "
 

We seek to inform and raise awarness around the correlation between the size of ecological footprints and the earth's overshoot day's date. 

This day has been coming earlier each year, since 1970. We strongly believe that people should have more access to the facts in a visual format. This will allow the user to get a clearer view on what has been happening and how much damage has been done to allow for change.
