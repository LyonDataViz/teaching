### The ecological impact of our food

Nowadays, we often hear about ecology when it comes to water or electricity consumption, or to greenhouse gas emissions by vehicles or factories... but food production and consumption is still a far too neglected factor : it is even one of its main sources.
We know that simply presenting facts and figures is not always a very efficient method to make the importance of various concepts understood, so we invite you to test your knowledge of this subject during a quizz which will show you what is the real cost of what you eat, and how to have more eco-friendly meals.
