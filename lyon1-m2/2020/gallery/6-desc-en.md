### Data Visualization of Deforestation

[demo](https://pltreger.github.io/Deforestation/)

Between 2004 and 2017, 43 million hectares of forests disappeared. 80% of global deforestation is caused by agriculture, with 20% of the remainder split between infrastructure construction first, then mining activities and finally urbanization. This deforestation has major impacts on biodiversity and climate.

We wanted, through this project, to show the part of human activity on deforestation in order to be able to raise public consciousness about deforestation. Through various d3js visualizations, we wanted to respond to the problem: "How could we show the different human factors responsible for deforestation?".
