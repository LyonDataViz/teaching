### The lives of our single use plastics within the marine flora and fauna in 2010

[demo](https://eyos-abebe.github.io/Projet_Plastique_Biodiversite/)

We use plastic consumption, ocean plastic pollution and sea and ocean biodiversity data to show the cohabitation of marine flora and fauna with plastics. We built an interactive world map and histogram to observe the biodiversity richness next to plastic consumption and pollution.
