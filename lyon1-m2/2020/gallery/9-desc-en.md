### Sea ice & CO2

[demo](https://github.com/bberthaud/Dataviz_Banquise-CO2)

The melting ice is a contemporary problem of global issue. Awareness on this subject is growing in our Western societies: we are overwhelmed with figures, but they sometimes lack context. This is why we offer you a storytelling with interactive dynamic graphics to study together the impact of CO2 emissions on the surface of sea ice (Arctic). 
We want to answer the following problem: How have the surface of sea ice and the CO2 emission rate evolved over the last decades? The objective is to highlight the correlation between the evolution of the CO2 emission rate with that of sea ice surface.
