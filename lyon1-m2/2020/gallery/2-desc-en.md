### Impact of global warming and human activity on Caribou herds

[demo](https://b2rj.github.io/Caribous/src/slide.html).

We have at our disposal a large panel of data about Caribou populations, located in British Columbia, a Canadian province. These data start in 1988 and end in 2016 and include different information like the individual geolocation, deployment and tracking. During certain periods, there is also some information about pregnancy and presence of calves.

In addition, we have in our possession a dataset of monthly average temperatures in British Columbia from 1743 to 2013.

We finally merge these different data together, allowing us to analyze and measure the impact of human activity and global warming which disrupt the Caribou ecosystem.
