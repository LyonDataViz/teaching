### Study about species extinction in the world

[demo](https://species-extinction.github.io/species-extinction/index.html)

This project offers a vizualisation of the extincted species in the world until 2009. For each country, it is possible to see the number of extincted species originaly living in this country. Moreover, one can learn more information for each country like the number of extincted species by extinction causes, the habitat type of these species, the extincted species list and the phylum (classification) of extincted species. Finally, a vizualisation showing the evolution of the number of extincted species over time is also available.
