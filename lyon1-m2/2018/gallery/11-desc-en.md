[140 years of temperature disturbance](https://bojulien.github.io/dataviz11/)


###Project presentation 
The topic of this project is the evolution of the global temperature between 1880 and 2017.
The principle is to show the global warming thanks to data visualisations and to warn people about this problem.

In order to achieve this we made several things :

A Bar Plot that shows the climate disturbance every decade
A Line Chart that shows the evolution of the anomalies
A map of the world that shows where and how the temperature is changing in the world
