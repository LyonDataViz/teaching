# European e-waste treatment

## English summary

We were interested in exploring the production of electronic waste (WEEE) in Europe. This thematic is one that echoes with us, as consummers, and citizens of the EU. We have created a few elements of visualisation, to describe in depth the statistics known on this phenonmenon. To achieve this, we have created a three pages website.

It consists in:
 - An introductory webpage that explains why the thematic is important and why we choose it, and helps contextualize the EU in the global flows of e-waste.
 - The main visualization, in the form of a dashboard:
   - An interactive map of the EU, displaying in color scale the quantity of e-waste per country.
   - A histogram showing the evolution of the total over the EU of the volume of waste
   - A diagram comparing for a given country the quantity of waste produced and collected for each type of e-waste. The country can be selected by left-clicking on the particular country on the map.
   - A histogram comparing for a given country the quantities produced for each category, for a given year.
   - A year selector, changing the map and second histogram to display the selected year.
   - A waste category selector, changing the map and the first histogram
   - A waste disposal step selector (production, collection, recycling), changing the map and the first histogram
   - An explanation of what the selected category and disposal step correspond to.
 - About page, linking to the course and Master webpage, giving the sources of the data, and with our names.
